// One Good Example to use for and for each loop
// Restrictions on using For each loop : 1. Cannot navigate by INDEX, and cannot iterate through the array in reverse order. Use for loop in such cases.
// Tip : Make sure to declare the variable based on the type of data present in the array
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Comparison between for and for each loop");
                String[] fruits = {"Apple","Orange","Banana"};
                for(int i= fruits.length-1; i>=0; i--){
                    System.out.println(fruits[i]);
                }

        for (String fruit:fruits
             ) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }

        }
    }
